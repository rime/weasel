
= How to Rime with Weasel =

0. Preparation

Assume we already have a default installation of Visual Studio 2010.

Install dev tools: git, cmake
Download third-party libraries: boost(==1.47.0)

NOTE: higher versions of boost are not garranteed to work,
due to the breaking changes in boost::inter_process.

1. Checkout source code

{{{
git clone git@github.com:lotem/weasel.git
cd weasel
git submodule update --init
}}}

2. Setup environment variables

Edit librime\env.bat.template according to your setup, save it as librime\env.bat .

3. Start VC command line tools from librime\shell.bat .

4. Build Boost

Make sure BOOST_ROOT is set to  \path\to\boost_1_47_0  in librime\env.bat .

In the command line, issue the following command from weasel directory:
{{{
cd librime
vcbuild.bat boost
}}}

5. Build other third-party libraries

including: glog, kyotocabinet, opencc, yaml-cpp
{{{
vcbuild.bat thirdparty
}}}

6. Build librime

{{{
vcbuild.bat
}}}

With some luck, you now have a copy of the built library in vcbuild\lib\Release:
  * static library - librime.lib
  * shared library - rime.dll / rime.lib

7. Play with Rime command line tools

{{{
copy /Y thirdparty\bin\*.dll vcbuild\bin\
cd vcbuild\bin
echo zhongzhouyunshurufa | Release\rime_console.exe > output.txt
}}}

8. Build weasel

Edit weasel\weasel.props.template, save it to weasel\weasel.props .

{{{
cd \path\to\weasel
build.bat all
}}}

Voila.

9. Install and try it live

{{{
cd output
install.bat
}}}
